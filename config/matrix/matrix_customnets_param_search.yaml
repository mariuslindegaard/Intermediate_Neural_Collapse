# Matrix for parsing into multiple configs to run with slurm
# Parsed as follows:
## All innermost values (leaves)  must be given in a list.
## For the current dictionairy level:
##   Any key other than "_Exclusive" is parsed and the innermost list of that key is used in the matrix.
##   If the key is _Exclusive, assume mutual exclusivity within the list of its contents,
##   and choose one of them to parse as another equivalent dictionary of values.
